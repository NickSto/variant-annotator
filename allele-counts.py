This will parse the VCF output of Dan's "Naive Variant Caller" (aka "BAM
Coverage") Galaxy tool. For each position reported, it counts the number of
reads of each base, determines the major allele, minor allele (second most
frequent variant), and number of alleles above a threshold.

Requirements:
input: The input VCF must report the variants per strand. Note: the variants
  are case-sensitive.
frequency: Alleles are only counted when they are above a default threshold
  of 1% frequency, but a different value can be given as the second argument.
coverage: Positions are required to have at least 100x coverage on each strand
  by default, but a different value can be given as the third argument.
  Positions below this coverage will not be reported.
strand bias: Both strands must show the same bases passing the frequency
  threshold (but not necessarily in the same order of frequency). If the
  position fails this test, the number of alleles is reported as 0."""
